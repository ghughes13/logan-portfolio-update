                    At the outset of the project we consolidate all available

                    stakeholders and relevant teams to explore different ideas
                    and plans. From here UX designers will engage with current
                    or potential customers if possible to understand their
                    desires, expectations, affinities, problems and pain points,

                    At times, brands are reluctant towards conducting prior
                    research as it demands time and resources, but the failure
                    to do so will assuredly cost in the long run. Without
                    appropriate research the true scope of customer needs cannot
                    be assessed and determined. Research and discovery is the
                    very foundation and impetus with which UI/UX design
                    decisions are driven. Instead of relying on intuitions and
                    gambles, it’s best to take a practical approach, and walk

                    With the research and discovery results we synthesize a
                    robust digital strategy, which in turn pilots the entire
                    design process. The digital strategy begins by exploring
                    different concepts and fine tuning key variables that will
                    define a strong strategic vertical. From here, we begin
                    concepting core elements such as information architecture
                    and overall UI direction. We finish off this phase by
                    presenting stakeholders with our concept for validation and
                    approval.

                    We kickoff this phase by hitting the ground running with our
                    freshly minted digital strategy and design concept. Various
                    activities are performed including wireframing, user flow
                    mapping, UI design, and prototyping. We utilize a
                    streamlined process of tools such as Zeplin to hand off our
                    assets to developers. A comprehensive brand style guide,
                    which includes component libraries, guidelines and user
                    maps, is also developed at this stage.
